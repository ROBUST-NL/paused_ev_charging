&#x2705; Many electric vehicle models lack the technical capabilities for effective smart charging, as they cannot handle charging pauses or delays. üöó üöô  <br>
&#x2705; Technical charging tests reveal that around one-third of tested car models suffer from these charging issues. <br>
&#x2705; Model simulations suggest that eliminating these problems would double the smart charging potential for all applications. <br>
&#x2705; Concrete legal and practical solutions are proposed to address these issues. ‚öñÔ∏è <br>

## Installation

***Step 1:*** Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
```

***Step 2:*** Install the required packages
The code is tested on [![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10.13-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3812/). The required packages are listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

For the optimization solver, we used [![gurobipy](https://img.shields.io/badge/gurobipy-11.0.1-blue.svg)](https://www.gurobi.com/)
