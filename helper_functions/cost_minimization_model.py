def optimization(session_data,DA_prices,timesteps):
    """
    In this model, the charging schedules for all considered charging sessions are optimized to minimize the charging costs in the day-ahead electricity market. 
    Parameters
    ----------
    session_data : pd.DataFrame
        Pandas dataframe containing information about the considered charging sessions. It should contain the following columns:
            'START_ROUNDED_CET': the arrival time of the EV to the charging station in CET, rounded to the nearest 15-minute timestamp.
            'STOP_ROUNDED_CET_lim': the departure time of the EV from the charging station in CET, rounded to the nearest 15-minute timestamp. 
            If the connection time to the charging station exceeds 24 hours, the departure time is set to 24 hours after the arrival time
            'VOL': the charging volume of the charging session in kWh. 
            'P_MAX': Maximum charging power of the charging session in kW.
            'P_MIN': Minimum charging power of the charging session in kW. Equal to 0 if delayed and paused charging is possible. 
    DA_prices : Series
        Day-ahead electricity prices for each timestep, in â‚¬/MWh.
    timesteps : list
        List of all considered timesteps in the optimization, in CET. 

    Returns
    -------
    m.objVal: float
        Objective value of the optimization model
